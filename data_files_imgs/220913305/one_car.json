So the engine should be good for a while. Condition issues are as follows: Accelerates a bit rough at the moment... cuts out and misses sometimes when pressing accelerator. No problems that I've noticed once at cruising speed, though. Automatic antenna broke off years ago. A small aluminum antenna is jury-rigged in place of this and radio reception is fine, but it doesn't look top notch. Rear hatch latch takes two hands to open. The part to repair this is about $150 if I recall, so it didn't seem worth it to me. There are a few minor parking-lot dents (see photos). Rear bumper has cracked surface from being rear-ended some years ago (it wasn't enough damage to bother making an insurance claim but it is a cosmetic issue. Driver seat has a seam coming loose. Should be easy to re-stitch it but I haven't gotten around to that. Looks good except for the small dents. These could probably be removed by paintless dent repair."}}
